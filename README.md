# Python inner working\*\*

## Install Python interpreter / software

## Python VM installs while installing python software -> here python code runs mainly

## Runs the script / programm -> Executes the instrunction / code

## Creates / compile to Byte code .pyc -> low level code & platform independent

## .pyc is also called Compiled python / Frozen Binaries

## .pyc only for imports not for top level files

## **pycache** -> to store frozen binaries

## This kind of languages use "Diffing algorithm" - "Difference finding algorithm" -> only changes the source code differences

# Python Virtual Machine (PVM)\*\*

## a loop runs continously, any given file will executes. It's called interpreted language, coz it interprets line by line.

## Byte code or direct python scripts can be fed to the PVM.

## PVM also called as Run Time Engine

\*\*

# Byte code is not Machine code\*\*

## Byte code specific interpretation

# Pyhton versions\*\*

## cpython, jpython, Ironpython, stackless, pypy
